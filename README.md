An attempt at writing a video player that splits up a video and plays it on four PIs in parallel. PIs have to synchronize so they have to find each other on the local network using SSDP, determine a master by playing TicTacToe(???) and then synchronize through the master.
The code held my attention for a while until it didn't. Looking back though it's a god damn mess so **DON'T JUDGE**.
Maybe I'll continue one day - but no promises.

Justus out.
